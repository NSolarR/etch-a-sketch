# What is this project?
    This project is a part of the odin project curriculum.
    The goal of this project is to test my DOM manipulation
    skills.
    
# Pre-project thoughts:
    I'm thinking this project will be relatively difficult.
    I'm not very confident with DOM manipulation at the
    moment. This'll be a good opportunity to ingrain what
    I've learnt though. 
    
    I also kind of want to try adding proper mobile support
    to this site with media queries. I haven't used
    them much before though so we'll so how complicated it
    iss.
