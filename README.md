# What is this project?
    This project is a part of the odin project curriculum.
    The goal of this project is to test my DOM manipulation
    skills.
    
# Pre-project thoughts:
    I'm thinking this project will be relatively difficult.
    I'm not very confident with DOM manipulation at the
    moment. This'll be a good opportunity to ingrain what
    I've learnt though. 
    
    I also kind of want to try adding proper mobile support
    to this site with media queries. I haven't used
    them much before though so we'll so how complicated it
    iss.
    
# Post-project thoughts:
    Project ended up not being as hard as i thought it'd
    be. Had a bit of trouble with generating the grid
    because it kept overflowing weirdly. Had to set
    the grid-template columns and rows in the js
    instead of the css. After it worked fine. Had a lot
    of fun though. It works weirdly on mobile because
    there isn't really an equivelant to the mouseover
    event.
